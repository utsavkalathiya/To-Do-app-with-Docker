This project demonstrates a simple containerized application deployed using Docker. It includes a backend service integrated with a database and APIs, allowing users to make requests (such as fetching a menu or retrieving stored data). The application runs inside Docker containers, making it portable and easy to deploy on different environments, including local machines or cloud services like AWS EC2, ECS, and ECR. Data is managed through Docker volumes, ensuring persistence even when containers are restarted. Throughout the project, I practiced creating and managing Docker images, running containers, working with networks, handling volumes, and cleaning up resources. This project highlights my ability to build, containerize, and manage modern applications with Docker while laying the foundation for scaling them to production-level cloud environments.
